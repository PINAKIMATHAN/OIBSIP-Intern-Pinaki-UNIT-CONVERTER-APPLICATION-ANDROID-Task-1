During my internship, I developed a user-friendly unit converter application using Android Studio. This project honed my coding skills and provided hands-on experience in mobile app development. Creating an intuitive interface and ensuring accurate conversions were key focuses of my work as per the task of Oasis Infobyte i.e., Android App Development ----TASK-1.
